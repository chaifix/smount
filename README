Smount is a library for mount sub file systems. For example if you want 
make a directory be your working space, you may use smount to organize 
files and directories under the root. 

First, you need mount your file system. Each sub FS has its own root 
and that's all what you need to initialize. Then you are able to oprate 
the FS, such as reading files, writing files, deleting files, etc. One 
of the important things is that you should check error code after every 
single operation and use sm_errstr to get error messages. 
    
See ./test for examples.
